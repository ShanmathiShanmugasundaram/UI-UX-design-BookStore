# UI/UX Design Prototype – Web Application

Welcome to my **initial UI/UX design prototype**, a front-end-only project showcasing the essential layout and design elements of a web-based platform. This project is created with the goal of building a clean, intuitive, and accessible user experience from scratch.

> 🔰 This is the **first version** of the design, focusing purely on layout and structure. No backend or database connectivity is implemented yet.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a series of static webpages that are part of a standard web application's user flow. Each page is designed using HTML5 and CSS, with a focus on visual clarity, usability, and simplicity.

It serves as a **foundation for future development**, where backend logic, form validations, and interactivity will be added.
